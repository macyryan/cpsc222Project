# CPSC 222 Final Project 
****
### Files Included
* **Project.ipynb** 
  * This technical report goes over everything from the data used, hypothesis, visualizations, testing, and classifiers. To run this file, run all cells in the report and everything should output within the Jupyter notebook. 
* **ProjectProposal.ipynb**
  * This is the project proposal that we submitted during DA5. It goes over the project in a rough outline. It is important to note that some things have changed from when I proprosed the project to when it is being submitted. This notebook is comprised entirely of markdown cells and does not need to be run. 
* **personal_data.csv**
  * This CSV file includes all the raw data used in this project. 
* **LineGraph.pdf, LineGraph2.pdf, DayVSteps.pdf, DayVScreenTime.pdf, Decision_tree.pdf**
  * These pdf files include all of the visualizations from 'project.ipynb'. I wanted to output them to pdfs so that they can be seen upclose and you can zoom in to see the details. 
* **utils.py**
  * I had a lot of difficulties with this utils file. Whenever I defined a function, when running my code in project.ipynb, I would get the same error: "AttributeError: module 'utils' has no attribute 'function'". I could not figure out why this was not working for any of my functions except read_file, even when I double checked spelling, saved in and reloaded all my cells, nothing was fixing it. Because of this problem I had to keep most utility code in my project.ipynb file. I tried to make my code as conciece as possible and explain everything clearly and neatly. Hopefully it is okay and I apologize for the inconvience.
